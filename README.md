# three-body-problem

Completed in 04/06/2020

An iterative derivative method was written in Python (using scipy and matplotlib libraries) to solve the Two Body Problem, before solving the Three Body Problem. Below is an example image of the three dimensional graphical outputs. The analysis showed that it is possible to solve the problem accurately, and with little processing needed, and can be applied to solving the N-Body Problem. The program was checked against Euler and Lagrange’s specific case solutions as well as ruling out the effects of chaos theory (proving that this solution is not brittle). Despite the assumptions that objects have perfect spheres, orbital patterns and follow Newtonian Mechanics, the program has an accurate enough output to be used in real-world applications such as weather forecasting and planets’ orbital patterns.
